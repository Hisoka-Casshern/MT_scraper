Specialized www.marinetraffic.com scraper, Takes a list of mmsi and scrapes the page for public data on specified ships.
Scraper simulates user input and takes control of the mouse and keyboard. Uses BeautfilSoup and Selenium. Some code is written in JavaScript and is accessed through Python using a string. This is the most recent version, any update to the page will need a change of implementation that deals with specific namings, etc.

I created a whole ship hierarchy that is used to classify ships and their data.
