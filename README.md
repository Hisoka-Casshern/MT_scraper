Specialized www.marinetraffic.com scraper, Takes a list of mmsi and scrapes the page for public data on specified ships.
A specific scraper that simulates user input. Uses BeautfilSoup and Selenium. Some code is written in JavaScript and is accessed through Python using a string. This is the most recent version, any update to the page will need a change of implementation that deals with specific namings, etc.

I created a whole ship hierarchy that is used to classify ships and their data.
